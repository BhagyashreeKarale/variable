Varx="ashwini"

# Assign a FLOATvalue to a variable named as vaRx.
vaRx=7.0

# Try to print it, to see if Varx and vaRx are same or not.
print(Varx)
print(vaRx)
# If not,then write your reason in the comment in your file.
#Varx and vaRx aren't the same as python is case sensitive.that's why v and V , r and R are different.
#therefore python treats Varx and vaRx as two differebt variables.
