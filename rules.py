# Rules for naming a VARIABLE
# In Python for naming variables, some rules are followed. 
# If we do not follow these rules, then the program is not going to be correct.

# Keep these 3 rules always in your mind :
# The name starts with either a - Letter or an _ (underscore).
# Only letters, underscore or numbers can be present in the Name(no special characters).
# It is Case Sensitive (means var, VAR, Var are different variables).

# Correct Names - variable, var123, var_12, _var, _12
# Incorrect Names - var@iable, 123var, var.123
# Different Names - varX, varx, Varx, VarX

# Activity: In Python shell``, try to put values in the Incorrect variable names. 
# See how python gives errors.
