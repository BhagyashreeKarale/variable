# Variables
# What are Variables ?
# VARIABLE is a memory/location in which the data is stored. Whose value we can change that is called a VARIABLE. You can give any name to the VARIABLE and you can store anything in the variable.

# Just as we can store 123 in a VARIABLE named as variable_x.

# Similarly we can put 9999 in a VARIABLE named as a.

# As you remember that 123 and 9999 are INTEGERS.

variable_x=123
a=9999
# Let's see what happens when we print variable_x and a.
print (variable_x, a)

# We can give another value to variable_x, by this variable_x will be updated. As you can see below that we have given a value 9.9 to the variable_x now.
variable_x=9.9

# Now print variable_x to see its value.
print (variable_x)

# As you remember that 9.9 is float. That means we can give different values to a variable. 
# Value of ais not changed because we have not updated it. 
# Now we can update a and make a new variable b.
a='hello world'
b='navgurukul'

# Now print them to see the output.
print (variable_x, a, b)
# Dry Run
# You all have to do these questions using pen and paper. Solve all the exercises in your notebooks and ask other people around you to check the solution.

# To understand about the dry run of variables,please see this video.


a = 3
b = 4
c = a * b
a = b * c
b = a + c
c = a + b + c
 
a = 1
b = 2
b = a
 
a = 7
b = 8 * 4
b = a
 
a = 1
b = 2
c = b
b = a 
a = c
 
a = 1
b = a*2
c = b*2
a = c*2
 
a = 100
a = a + 50
a = a / 3
a = a * 2
 
a = 10
b = 10
c = a * b
a = c - b
b = c + a
c = a * c
